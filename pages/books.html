      <br />
      <p><em>Status: Completed</em></p>
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> I learned a lot about sharing markets that take advantage of underutilized assets to make productive gains. There is a lot more that goes on to platforms like Uber, Airbnb, Etsy, etc. that I thought there were.</p>

      <strong>Technological Republic by Alex Karp</strong>
      <br />
      <p><em>Status: Completed</em></p>
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Extremely captivating, changed my thought process on what constitutes meaningful innovation. There should be a reconnect between engineers and government. Furthermore we should rethink about why it is we, as engineers, outright oppose military work, and whether we hold any biases in this view.</p>
